Networks can be configured to provide complete isolation for containers, which enable building applications that work together securely.

You can create multiple networks and add containers to one or more networks. A container with attachments to multiple networks can connect with all of the containers on all of those networks. This lets you build a “hub” of sorts to connect to multiple networks and separate concerns.

=== add network

You can use kbd:[Ctrl] to select multiple networks
