Networks can be configured to provide complete isolation for containers, which enable building applications that work together securely.

You can add containers to one or more networks. A container with attachments to multiple networks can connect with all of the containers on all of those networks. This lets you build a “hub” of sorts to connect to multiple networks and separate concerns.

=== multiple network

To add more  *networks* we use the network icon
