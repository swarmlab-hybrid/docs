This is the area where you will learn to connect volumes

== connect

As usual we can get info using the image:venus:volume-more.png[] icon

.connect volume
image::venus:volume-shared-info.png[Volume shared info,700,float=center]

TIP: to get info about a network we first have to select it


to connect to a volume we use the image:hybrid:more.png[] icon 

we will be greeted by the following:

.connect volume
image::venus:volume-connect.png[Volume connect,700,float=center]

here we can just click the btn:[Connect_to] button 

Our volume should be visible under *My Connections on Shared volumes*

WARNING: this step ONLY initialized the server connection and not the actual file system

=== Connect info

information about what we just did can be found in the menu 

.volume info
image::venus:volume-connect-info.png[Volume connect info,700,float=center]

TIP: the image:venus:volume-mount-no.png[] icon tells us if the file system dir is mounted or not


=== mount

we use the 
image:venus:volume-mount-no.png[]
icon 

=== umount

we use the 
image:venus:volume-mount-yes.png[]
icon


=== mount info

to locate the shared directory wew use the image:venus:volume-info-icon.png[] icon

This can be found under *My Connections on Shared volumes* and next to the corresponding volume

e.g. the dir in the example is 

[source,bash]
----
/data/appl/ok/swarmlab-venus/src-local/hybrid/connect/dLZWqFyPxyxOL1DiJ3xCHJhi6ziLK7MJ/volumes_client/dLZWqFyPxyxOL1DiJ3xCHJhi6ziLK7MJ_volumename
----

here we can place any files we want to share

TIP: This only works as long as the image:venus:volume-mount-yes.png[] is visible.

== disconnect

to disconnect we use the  image:venus:volume-delete-icon.png[] icon 

that can be found in the *My Connections on Shared volumes* menu and next to the corresponding entry.


TIP: When disconnecting, only the connection is terminated and the actual data remains untouched.
