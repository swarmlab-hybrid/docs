To share a volume we will be using the  image:venus:volume-share-icon.png[] icon 

and be greeted by the following menu:

.create volume
image::venus:volume-create.png[Volume create,700,float=center]

Please choose a name before clicking on the btn:[Create Volume] button 

You can now locate the volume under *My shared Volumes*

=== Directory info

To locate the shared directory we can use the image:venus:volume-info-icon.png[] icon

This is located under the *My shared Volumes* and next to the corresponding volume.

.volume directory info

e.g. the dir from the example is 

[source,bash]
----
/data/appl/ok/swarmlab-venus/src-local/hybrid/connect/dLZWqFyPxyxOL1DiJ3xCHJhi6ziLK7MJ/volumes/dLZWqFyPxyxOL1DiJ3xCHJhi6ziLK7MJ_myvolume

here we can drop any file we would like to share

=== delete

To delete we can simply use the image:venus:volume-delete-icon.png[] icon 

again found under the *My shared Volumes* menu and next to the corresponding volume.

.volume info
