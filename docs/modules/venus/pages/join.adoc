=== info 

To request more info about the *network* we use the

 icon

.browsing network
image::venus:join-info.png[network info,700,float=center]

=== Request access

To request network access we use the btn:[Request Access] button

TIP: the button is only visible if youre NOT already connected!


== Connect

image:venus:join-status.png[network connect,300,float=right]

After requesting access and it being granted by the owner we will be able to see the accept icon.

when this icon appears it meant we are ready to use the network using the btn:[Start Network] button

obviously the network has to be up and running

the *join* column informs us about our connection status

TIP: we can connect as many networks as we please

=== connect mode

.connect mode
image::venus:join-connect-mode.png[connect modus,700,float=center]

The *host* option is used to make the interface look like they are running on the host itself

The *container* option containerizes the containers networking 

==== host


image:venus:host-connection.png[host connect,350,float=right]

It allows the Virtual Network Interface greater network access than it can normally get.

If you use 'host' then you’ll get all ports listening on the host. 

This means you will have to monitor the services you run closely (especially if it’s not yours, e.g. an official one provided by a software project) to make sure you don’t inadvertently expose extra services to the network.

TIP: With this option you *can* access the other participants in the network and vice versa from your computer 

==== container

image:venus:container-connection.png[container connect,350,float=right]

A container option is used to isolate the services from the outside world

TIP: With this option you can *NOT* access the other participants in the network and vice versa from your computer 

=== connect status

.connect status
image::venus:join-connect-status.png[connect status,700,float=center]

after connecting we will be seing something along the following: 

* our status in the *join* column
* the btn:[Leave Network] button we can use to disconnect
* the *Interface* name and whether it is up or down
* the creted *Network*(interface) name

=== connect info

all of the above information is also accessible using the btn:[Service Info] button

.connect status info
image::venus:join-connect-status-info.png[connect status info,700,float=center]
