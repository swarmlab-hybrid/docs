= Welcome to Hybrid!
  
Swarmlab hybrid provides the user with the unique abillity to create Labrooms (or other applications) and share them as project images expanding the simple swarmlab Labrooms to full-blown systems.

An all of that using onlly the browser and the command line of their system.

== How?

You will be connected to the Swarmlab Cloud (hence HYBRID) but you will be able to use your own storage(move files around, delete/copy etc),your own networking and computational power(cpu/graphics etc) and create a system exactly the way you need it.

This way you will be able to :

* create images for testing.
* Run them using docker.
* Share them for others to use and develop.
* Finally browse the cloud for shared images to integrate into your project and make it even better.




=== Ready to run out-of-the-box


Normally the docker dataflow is as described in the following images:

To make the service easier to use we have created an ever-growing database of readilly accessible images you can choose from, thus making the first step optionall!


* Create Labrooms/Applications
* Run and manage said rooms and application
* create once - scale up or down without rebuilding
* Connect multiple computers through a network.
* Move Labs between environments
* Create your own labs
* open source barebone -> Share them with your friends
