= Welcome to Swarmlab!
  
image::ROOT:swarmlab.png[swarmlab,150,float=right]

Swarmlab provides the user with the unique abillity to *create Labrooms* (or other applications) and *share* them as project images expanding the simple ideas to full-blown systems.

An all of that using only the browser and the command line of their system.

== Intro

You will be connected to the Swarmlab Cloud (hence HYBRID) but you will be able to use your own storage(move files around, delete/copy etc),your own networking and computational power(cpu/graphics etc) and create a system exactly the way you need it.

This way you will be able to :

* create images for testing.
* Run them using docker.
* Share them for others to use and develop.
* Finally browse the cloud for shared images to integrate into your project and make it even better.

== Ready to run out-of-the-box

Normally the docker dataflow is as described in the following images:
